      "Ethiopian Investment Board\nDirective to Regulate Foreign Investors' Participation in Restricted Export, Import, Wholesale and Retail Trade Investments No. 1001/2024\n\nMarch 2024 Addis Ababa\n# Ethiopian Investment Board <br> Directive to Regulate Foreign Investors' Participation in Restricted Export, Import, Wholesale and Retail Trade Investments No. 1001/2024 \n\nAcknowledging that a policy of building sustainable national economy that is anchored on domestic capabilities has been pursued to date, and in this tune, the Investment Regulation No.474/2020 has shielded select trading sectors from foreign investment competition in order to facilitate a qualitative and quantitate growth of domestic investors, their integration into the global trade value chain, and eventually their transition to value-added investments;\nRecognizing that in spite of the limited outcomes recorded to date, the policy objective has not been attained on the scale anticipated - that corresponds to the long duration that elapsed since policy implementation commenced, and the protected sectors have been subjected to complaints relating to service reach, quality and efficiency, and are furthermore exposed to an increasing bent of unlawful practices;\nRealizing that additional gaps - challenging the policy's objective have been identified stemming from the absence of fair competition practice in the restricted sectors and deficiencies in regulatory oversight;\nUnderstanding that a new approach must be pursued that reorders the existing national policy rational on reserving the export, import, wholesale and retail trade sectors to domestic investors, promotes the sectors' gradual opening to willing and capable foreign investors, and engages in further liberalization measures based on practical appraisal of the implementation process and valuation of the changes and benefits thus realized;\nNow, therefore, pursuant to its powers vested under Article 6(4) and Article 31(1)(e) of the Investment Proclamation, the Ethiopian Investment Board has issued this Directive.",
