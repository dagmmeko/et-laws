              "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this policy document, the term water supply includes water supply for human as well as animal consumption, industrial and other uses outside irrigation and hydropower.\n\nAs far as water supply for human consumption is concerned, it is to be noted that over 85% of Ethiopians' livelihood is based on farming and livestock agriculture. This has consequently resulted in subsistence level of economic life and thinly spread out settlement so that providing reliable and safe water at minimum cost becomes very difficult. Hence over 90% of the population living in rural Ethiopia have no access to potable water. People have to travel long distances for many hours and fetch unsafe and unreliable water from rivers and other undeveloped sources. Even in urban centers where services are apparently better in relative terms, the supply and quality of water is inadequate and unreliable compared to the demand.\n\nThese shortcomings will have to be solved sooner than later to achieve rapid socio\neconomic development through better health care and productivity of the Ethiopian peoples. In order to attain sustainable and equitable solutions to these problems due attention has been accorded by the FDRE government to find policy options.\n\nAs for the livestock water supply, as mentioned earlier, the majority of Ethiopian people engaged in farming and pasteurization are forced to drive the livestock long distances, both in the highland and lowland areas, in search of water and pasture. In so doing, the lowland community in particular, faces frequent socio-economic and security hazards.\n\nWhile herding their cattle from place to place in search of water and green pasture following the rainfall, they move away from centers of social services like health care, clean water, education.... etc provided by the state and are not even as privileged as the farmers.\n\nAs far as the economic problems are concerned, the long distance movement of the livestock in search of water and pasture resulting in low yields and poor health has a negative impact on the economy.\n\nOn the security aspect again the livestock wandering from place to place in search of water and pasture will compete for the limited grazing area and water resources which subsequently result in ethnic strifes. Hence, the water sector will have to formulate appropriate policies and devise implementing strategies for the supply of water for livestock both in the highland and lowland areas. This policy gives emphasis to the inclusion of livestock water supply in every water development plan and activity in ways and means deemed necessary.\n\nWater supply for the industrial sector is a recent development in the Ethiopian context. Agriculture - based industrial development is the core element in the Federal\neconomic development strategy. Those types of agro- industries are characterised by their immense intake requirement of water and huge wastewater discharge. Regions and bigger towns willing to create attractive environs for investors need to make arrangements to supply sufficient industrial water and waste water treatment services at nominal price. Water resources development plans and programmes should anticipate and include in their undertakings water supply and wastewater treatment plants for future industries.\n\nThus, this water supply and sanitation policy is developed to provide impetus for the development of water supply for human and animal consumption, for industrial and other uses in terms of coverage, quantity, reliability and acceptable quality taking the existing and future realities of the country into consideration.",

              "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn general, Ethiopia has an annual rainfall apparently adequate for food crop production and pasture for livestock. The spatial and temporal distribution of the rainfall, however, is too uneven.\n\nMuch of the eastern part of Ethiopia receives very little rain while the western part, the highland areas in particular, enjoy adequate rainfall. Reliable food supply is almost impossible due to the temporal imbalance in the distribution of rainfall and the consequential nonavailability of the required water at the required period. This is a frequent phenomenon in Ethiopia. Sometimes even the western highlands of the country suffer from food shortages owing to discrepancies in rainfall distribution.\n\nThe National Economic Development Strategy places heavier emphasis on the agricultural sector to enhance food-self-sufficiency and ensure food security at the household level and to develop an agriculture-based industrial development in the long run. This strategic approach can be achieved through the augmentation of agricultural productivity which calls for mitigating water shortage problems as a pre-condition.\n\nWater can be made to contribute to the national economy through the development of the country's water resources and expanding irrigation schemes so that agricultural production is improved by solving the problem of water shortage caused by the unpredictability of the rainfall. This is what this policy intends to achieve.\nThe area of irrigated agriculture cultivated so far is insignificant compared to the irrigable potential. Sufficient food has to be produced to meet the requirements of the fast growing population and ensure food security for eventualities at household level. Furthermore, small, medium and large scale irrigation schemes will have to be developed in order to enhance reliable agricultural development in Ethiopia to cater for externally marketable surplus that would earn the country foreign exchange and at the same time provide raw material inputs for industries.\n\nIrrigation being a development activity requiring huge capital investment, large and convenient infrastructure and trained human resources; this policy has been formulated to foster the realization of reliable and sustainable irrigation development which is harmonious with the capabilities and realities of the country and the development strategies designed.",

              "INTRODUCTION\n\nEthiopia is a country endowed with large hydropower potential. According to studies made in river basins, the hydropower resource is estimated to have a potential in the order of 161,000 Gwh/year. So far, however, only a fraction of this tremendous potential has been harnessed for any meaningful contribution to the socio-economic development of the country.\n\nThis is because the previous regiems had not given due attention to the development of the water sector, like other sectors and did not have the awareness that the development of the sector was not only a precondition for the acceleration of the development of other sectors but also a foreign exchange earning economic resource.\n\nEthiopia's physiographical nature and her endowment in water resources are natural assets which facilitate the generation of power with a relatively lower production cost. The energy to be generated will not only cater for the increasingly growing demand for energy in the country but will have surplus production to be marketed to neighboring countries. This will earn the Gross National Economy substantial foreign exchange perhaps not less than other exportable commodities.\n\nIt is with these overall objectives that due emphasis has been provided to the sector and this policy has been formulated accordingly.",
